Welcome to my site! I hope to populate this page with fun data analysis and ridiculous data collection methodology I've been working on over the years. Some stuff I'm currently working on:

* Collecting 7 million Twitter geoObjects over an entire month to see if they paint a map
* Shortest path algorithms applied to the Japanese overground train network
* Mathematically drawing virtual subway extensions which piggyback on the "thru service" contract lines in the Toei Subway and Tokyo Metro networks
* Mapping my transit activity over the year and see how implementing distance-based pricing would change my travel
* I'm keeping a travel diary over the entire year
* I'm booking flights on Air Canada that have a tendency to be overbooked and trying to make money from getting bumped thanks to the new Passenger Bill of Rights
* Me racing the LRT and winning
* What if McDonald's had a loyalty program like Marriott Bonvoy?

The best way to keep track of my activity is to follow or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryan7ran/)!

EDIT April 2: I'm also experimenting with tooltips inline for acronyms and other technical info that I'd like to include in blog! But learning CSS is proving to be a bit difficult. My latest success:

<body>Test test test test <div class="tooltip">Air Canada 3
  <span class="tooltiptext">Vancouver (YVR) to Tokyo-Narita (NRT) @ 13:50</span>
</div> and then we continue writing in Markdown</body>
