Welcome to my site! I hope to populate this page with fun data analysis and ridiculous data collection methodology I've been working on over the years. Some stuff I'm currently working on:

* Collecting 3 million Twitter geoObjects over an entire month to see if they paint a map (to be blogged December 2019!)
* Shortest path algorithms applied to Japanese train networks (to be blogged December 2019!)
* Mapping my transit activity over the year and see how implementing distance-based pricing would change my travel
* I'm keeping a travel diary over the entire year (to be blogged early 2020)
* I'm booking flights on Air Canada that have a tendency to be overbooked and trying to make money from getting bumped
* Me racing the LRT and winning

The best way to keep track of my activity is to follow or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryan7ran/)!

EDIT November 2: I'm also experimenting with tooltips inline for acronyms and other technical info that I'd like to include in blog! But learning CSS is proving to be a bit difficult. My latest success:

<body>Test test test test <div class="tooltip">Air Canada 3
  <span class="tooltiptext">Vancouver (YVR) to Tokyo-Narita (NRT) @ 13:50</span>
</div> and then we continue writing in Markdown</body>
